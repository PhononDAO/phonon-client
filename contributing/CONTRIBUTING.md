# Contributing to Phonon client

First of all, contributions are all very welcome. If you're unsure or afraid of anything, please submit an issue or pull request anyways. We're all very friendly and we deeply appreciate your interests and best efforts.

## Issues

Ensure that you've used the latest version before submitting a bug report. We may have already provided a fix for the issue.

We've provided an issue template that helps set the guidelines on what we expect to help provide us with enough information to understand the problem and provide a solution.

We may ask questions and so we ask that you respond as quickly as possible to your issue.

## Pull requests

Before creating a pull request, we ask that you create an issue for it or atleast reference an existing issue. This will help prevent duplication and overlapping in WIP work, and to allow us to provide more guidance.

Your pull request should be descriptive, containing how it works and what has changed.

Changes may be requested in your pull request. We ask that you do not use the resolve prompt to resolve your own issues. We will use this prompt once we can verify that the changes are made. It's important to note that before you may attempt to merge your request, we require at least one Phonon core developer to approve the change. There must also be no conflicts with `master`, and the CI must pass. prior.
